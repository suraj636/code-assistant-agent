"""
11_autonomous_agents.py: Implementation of Atomic Task Claiming and Self-Organization.

Motto: "Teammates scan the board and claim tasks themselves"

This module evolves the multi-agent architecture from "Delegation" (s09/s10) to 
"Autonomy." In this model, the Lead Agent does not manage individuals; it 
manages the Task Board. Background agents (Workers) poll the board, resolve 
dependencies, and claim tasks using thread-safe locking.

Key Architectural Concepts:
    1. Shared Task Board: A centralized JSON file acting as a "Blackboard" 
       architecture for agent coordination.
    2. Atomic Claiming: Uses `threading.Lock` to ensure that even with multiple 
       agents polling simultaneously, a task is never assigned to more than 
       one worker (preventing race conditions).
    3. Self-Organization: Agents identify "unblocked" tasks (where dependencies 
       are 'done') and move them from 'pending' to 'in_progress'.
    4. Resilience: If an agent fails during a task, the status is marked as 
       'failed', allowing for manual or automated retry logic.

Operational Flow:
    - Lead: Posts a high-level goal broken into task graph entries.
    - Workers: Continuously poll the board -> Claim task -> Execute -> Post Result.
