"""
10_team_protocols.py: Implementation of an FSM-Governed Agent Communication Protocol.

Motto: "Teammates need shared communication rules"

This module introduces formal state management for agent interactions. In previous 
sessions (s09), agents communicated loosely via mailboxes. s10 enforces a 
strict Finite State Machine (FSM) to ensure that agents are in predictable 
states during the request-response lifecycle.

Key Architectural Concepts:
    1. Deterministic State Tracking: Every agent exists in one of four states: 
       IDLE, REQUESTING, WAITING, or RESPONDING.
    2. Concurrency Protection: Uses `threading.Lock` to ensure that state 
       transitions and mailbox I/O are atomic, preventing "lost updates."
    3. Protocol Enforcement: Prevents "talking over" or "deadlocking" by 
       ensuring an agent cannot accept a new request while it is already 
       RESPONDING or WAITING.
    4. Encapsulation: The `ProtocolAgent` class bundles identity, state, 
       mailbox access, and the autonomous execution loop into a single unit.

FSM States:
    - IDLE: Ready to receive tasks.
    - REQUESTING: In the process of writing a task to another agent.
    - WAITING: Task sent; blocked until a reply is received.
    - RESPONDING: Currently running its own LLM loop to fulfill a request.
