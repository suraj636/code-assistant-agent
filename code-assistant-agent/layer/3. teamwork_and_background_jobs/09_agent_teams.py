"""
09_agent_teams.py: Implementation of a Persistent Multi-Agent Team Framework.

Motto: "When the task is too big for one, delegate to teammates"

This module introduces a "Lead-specialist" architecture. Unlike s04 subagents, 
which were ephemeral and spawned on-demand, these teammates are persistent 
background threads with specific roles. They communicate using "Mailboxes" 
implemented as JSONL files.

Key Architectural Concepts:
    1. Role Specialization: Agents are defined with specific personas 
       (e.g., Explorer, Writer) to improve accuracy in specific domains.
    2. Asynchronous Mailboxes: Communication is decoupled using the 
       filesystem. A sender writes a JSONL entry to a recipient's inbox; 
       the recipient polls, processes, and writes a reply back.
    3. Concurrency: Teammates run in dedicated background threads, allowing 
       the Lead agent to delegate tasks without losing its own state.
    4. Synthesis: The Lead agent acts as an orchestrator, receiving raw 
       data from teammates and synthesizing it into a final answer for the user.

Teaching Note:
    This version uses JSONL for simplicity and visibility. In production 
    environments (see s22), this is typically replaced with a robust 
    Message Broker like Redis or RabbitMQ.
