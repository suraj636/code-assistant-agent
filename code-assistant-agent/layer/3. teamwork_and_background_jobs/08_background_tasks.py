"""
08_background_tasks.py: Implementation of Asynchronous Shell Command Execution.

Motto: "Run slow operations in the background; the agent keeps thinking"

This module introduces a non-blocking execution model for the agent. In previous 
sessions, calling a tool like 'bash' would block the agent until the command 
finished. For operations that take minutes (e.g., full test suites, large 
installations), this is inefficient.

Key Architectural Concepts:
    1. Multi-threading: Background tasks are spawned in 'daemon' threads, 
       ensuring they don't block the main application flow.
    2. Thread-Safe Communication: A `queue.Queue` is used to safely pass 
       completion notifications from background threads back to the main thread.
    3. Event Injection: Between interaction turns, the system checks the 
       notification queue and "injects" completed results into the agent's 
       conversation history as fresh user input.
    4. Non-Blocking Feedback: The tool returns immediately with a confirmation, 
       allowing the agent to proceed with other sub-tasks.

State Mapping:
    - Main Loop: Handles user interaction and tool calls.
    - Worker Threads: Execute long-running shell commands.
    - Notification Queue: Bridges the gap between the two.
