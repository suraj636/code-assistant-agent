"""
12_worktree_task_isolation.py: Implementation of Git Worktree Task Isolation.

Motto: "Each works in its own directory, no interference"

This module addresses the risks of parallel agent execution in a shared 
codebase. When multiple agents run simultaneously, they may attempt to edit 
the same files, resulting in corrupted states. This script solves this by 
assigning every task its own 'Git Worktree'.

Key Architectural Concepts:
    1. Git Worktree: A feature of Git that allows having multiple working 
       trees attached to the same repository, each checked out to a 
       different branch.
    2. Branch Isolation: Each task creates a unique branch (e.g., task/abc123). 
       This keeps the 'main' branch clean until work is verified.
    3. Directory Switching: The execution environment dynamically changes 
       directories (`os.chdir`) to ensure tool outputs (like file writes) 
       happen in the correct isolated path.
    4. Parallel Concurrency: Using Python's `threading` module to run 
       multiple agents in their respective worktrees at the same time.

Operational Flow:
    - Task Start -> Create Git Branch -> Create Worktree Directory.
    - Agent Execution -> Perform work inside the worktree path.
    - Task Completion -> Result extraction -> Cleanup (Remove worktree/branch).
