"""
20_cache_optimization.py: Implementation of Anthropic Prompt Caching (KV Cache).

Motto: "Never rebuild what you've already sent"

This module demonstrates how to utilize Anthropic's Prompt Caching feature. 
Caching allows the API to store a 'prefix' of the conversation (System prompt, 
tools, and early history) on their servers. When a 'Cache Hit' occurs, 
the model processes the input significantly faster and at a fraction of 
the normal input token cost.

Key Architectural Concepts:
    1. Cache Control Blocks: The system prompt is structured as a list of 
       content blocks, with a `cache_control` flag on the final block.
    2. Tool Definition Caching: By adding a `cache_control` marker to the 
       last entry in the tools array, the entire toolset is cached.
    3. Ephemeral Caching: Markers use the 'ephemeral' type, which typically 
       lives for 5 minutes and is refreshed on every hit.
    4. Usage Monitoring: Accessing `response.usage` allows us to calculate 
       Cache Hits (cheap) vs. Cache Misses (expensive).

Operational Benefits:
    - Reduced Latency: Faster Time To First Token (TTFT).
    - Reduced Cost: Input tokens read from cache are billed at a ~90% discount.
