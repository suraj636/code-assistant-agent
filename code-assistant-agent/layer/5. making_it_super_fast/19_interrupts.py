"""
19_interrupts.py: Implementation of Real-Time Agent Interrupt Injection.

Motto: "Ctrl+C steers the agent; you're always in control"

This module addresses the "Runaway Agent" problem. In previous sessions, once 
an agent started a complex task, the user had to wait for it to finish or 
kill the process entirely. s19 introduces a "Soft Interrupt" pattern using 
asynchronous queues.

Key Architectural Concepts:
    1. Asyncio Queue: Acts as an out-of-band communication channel to inject 
       user commands into the agent's thought process mid-turn.
    2. Lifecycle Interruption: The agent checks the interrupt queue at two 
       critical points: 
          a) Before calling the LLM (to see if the goal changed).
          b) Before executing tools (to prevent unwanted actions).
    3. Graceful Degradation: If interrupted, the agent is instructed to 
       immediately stop, summarize its current progress, and wait for 
       further instructions.
    4. Signal Handling: The main loop distinguishes between a Ctrl+C at the 
       command prompt (system exit) and a Ctrl+C during agent activity 
       (task interrupt).

Operational Flow:
    - User hits Ctrl+C during agent loop -> Message put in Queue.
    - Agent finishes current tool -> Sees Queue message -> Appends to history.
    - Agent summarizes and stops.
