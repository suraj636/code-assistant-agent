"""
01_perception_action_loop.py: The Fundamental AI Agent Interaction Loop.

Motto: "One loop & bash is all you need"

This script serves as the entry point for the agent series, demonstrating the 
foundational "Thinking-Acting" cycle. It implements a synchronous interaction 
pattern where the LLM is prompted, evaluates if it needs to use a tool (specifically 
the 'bash' tool in this session), executes that tool, and continues until a 
final text response is produced.

The loop handles:
    1. Message history state management.
    2. API communication with Anthropic.
    3. Conditional logic based on 'stop_reason'.
    4. Synchronous tool dispatching.

    Executes the autonomous interaction cycle between the User and the LLM.

    This function implements a 'While-True' loop that persists as long as the 
    Model indicates it needs to perform actions (tool_use). It manages the 
    transition of state by appending assistant responses and tool results 
    to the conversation history.

    Args:
        messages (List[Dict[str, Any]]): The shared conversation history. 
            This list is modified in-place.
        dispatch (Dict[str, Any]): A mapping of tool names to callable 
            Python functions that handle the model's requests.

    Returns:
        None: The function modifies the input 'messages' list directly.
