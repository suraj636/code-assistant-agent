"""
03_todo_write.py: Implementation of Agentic Planning and State Tracking.

Motto: "An agent without a plan drifts"

This module introduces a task management system that the AI agent must use to 
organize complex, multi-step operations. By persisting a plan to a JSON file, 
the agent creates a "Source of Truth" for its progress, which significantly 
reduces hallucinations and logic errors in long-running tasks.

New Capabilities:
    1. todo_write: Serializes a list of task descriptions to a JSON file.
    2. todo_read: Deserializes and displays the current state of the plan.
    3. todo_update: Modifies the status of specific tasks (pending -> done).

The core of this session is the 'System Prompt' which mandates the use of 
these tools, effectively creating a "Think-Plan-Act" pipeline.
