02_tool_use.py: Implementation of the Scalable Tool Dispatch Map Pattern.

Motto: "Adding a tool means adding one handler"

This script demonstrates the second evolution of the AI agent architecture. 
Unlike s01, which had a hardcoded tool loop, s02 utilizes a 'Dispatch Map' 
strategy. This decouples the agent's decision-making process from the 
execution of specific tasks.

Key Architectural Concepts:
    1. Separation of Concerns: The agent loop (stream_loop) handles the 
       conversation flow, while the Dispatch Map (EXTENDED_DISPATCH) handles 
       the execution of specific capabilities.
    2. Scalability: To add a new capability (e.g., database access, web search), 
       a developer only needs to update the tool schema and the dispatch map. 
       The core logic remains untouched.
    3. Abstraction: By using the `stream_loop` from the `core` module, we 
       centralize the complexity of streaming API responses and recursive 
       tool calls.

    This function initializes the session state (history) and enters a 
    Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL). It captures user input and hands over 
    control to the `stream_loop` for autonomous tool execution.

        #   3. If the model calls a tool, look up the function in `EXTENDED_DISPATCH`.
        #   4. Execute the tool, append results, and repeat until the task is done.
