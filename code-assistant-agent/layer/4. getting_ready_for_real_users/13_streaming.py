"""
13_streaming.py: Implementation of Real-Time Token Streaming for AI Agents.

Motto: "Tokens print as they arrive — the terminal feels alive"

This module demonstrates the transition from synchronous, blocking API calls 
to a streaming architecture. In traditional requests (s01-s12), the user 
must wait for the entire completion to be generated before seeing any text. 
With streaming, partial text chunks are processed and displayed as soon as 
the model emits them.

Key Architectural Concepts:
    1. Event-Driven UI: Utilizing the `text_stream` iterator to provide 
       immediate visual feedback in the terminal.
    2. Context Managers: Using the `with` statement to ensure the streaming 
       connection is properly established and closed.
    3. State Finalization: Using `stream.get_final_message()` to retrieve 
       the complete Message object (including metadata and tool calls) after 
        the stream concludes.
    4. Perceived Latency: Reducing the "Time To First Token" (TTFT) to 
       milliseconds, making the agent feel more responsive and interactive.

Technological Note:
    While `core.stream_loop()` handles this under the hood for most sessions, 
    this script makes the implementation explicit for educational purposes.
