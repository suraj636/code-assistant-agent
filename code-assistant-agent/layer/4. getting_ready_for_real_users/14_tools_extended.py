14_tools_extended.py: Implementation of a Safety-First Extended Tool Arsenal.

Motto: "More hands, but every touch is reversible"

This module demonstrates the practical application of the 'Extended Toolset' 
defined in core.py. While previous sessions relied heavily on raw 'bash' 
commands, s14 promotes specialized tools (read, write, grep, glob) that 
provide structured outputs and automatic state recovery.

Key Architectural Concepts:
    1. Automated Snapshots: Every call to 'write' automatically backs up the 
       original file content to an in-memory store before overwriting.
    2. Reversibility: The 'revert' tool allows the agent to undo its last 
       change if a code edit introduces bugs or fails a test.
    3. Structured Output: The 'read' tool provides 1-indexed line numbers, 
       making it easier for the LLM to identify specific locations for edits 
       compared to raw 'cat' output.
    4. Efficiency: 'grep' and 'glob' provide faster, more reliable file 
       discovery than piping multiple shell commands together.

Why prefer these over Bash?
    Raw bash commands like `sed` or `echo > file` are destructive and 
    opaque to the harness. Specialized tools provide the harness with 
    hooks for logging, security filtering, and state management.
