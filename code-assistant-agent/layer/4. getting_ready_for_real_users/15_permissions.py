"""
15_permissions.py: Implementation of Rule-Based Permission Governance.

Motto: "Trust is earned; every action is judged before it runs"

This module introduces a "Guarded Dispatch" pattern. In previous sessions, 
tool calls were executed immediately. s15 wraps every tool execution with 
a security check that evaluates the command against a YAML-based policy 
configuration (`config/permissions.yaml`).

Governance Tiers (evaluated in order):
    1. always_deny: Immediate block. The agent is informed of the policy violation.
    2. always_allow: Silent pass. Typically used for read-only or safe commands.
    3. ask_user: Interactive confirmation. The terminal pauses and prompts the 
       human operator for a (y/N) decision.

Architectural Concept:
    By wrapping the dispatch map with a `_guarded` function, we separate the 
    logic of "what the tool does" from "who is allowed to do it," allowing 
    for centralized security audits without modifying tool code.

from typing import List, Dict, Any, Callable, Tuple, Optional  # For robust type hinting

# === Local Module Imports ===
# We import both the tool definitions and the permission logic from core.
from core import (
    EXTENDED_TOOLS,      # JSON schemas for the agent tools
    stream_loop,         # The core autonomous loop logic

)

# === Configuration and Initialization ===

# Load the permission rules from the external YAML file at script startup.
# This ensures that policies are consistent across the session.
RULES: Dict[str, Any] = load_rules()

# Define the agent's persona, acknowledging the security constraints.

    "Security protocols are active. Some of your commands may require "
    "explicit user approval via a [PERMISSION] prompt. If a command is denied, "
    "seek an alternative way to accomplish the task within the permitted bounds."
