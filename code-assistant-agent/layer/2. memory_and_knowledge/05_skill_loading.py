"""
05_skill_loading.py: Implementation of On-Demand Knowledge Retrieval.

Motto: "Load knowledge when you need it, not upfront"

This module introduces a 'Meta-Tooling' approach to solve the "Context Window 
Bloat" problem. Instead of stuffing every possible instruction, guideline, 
or specialized SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) into the System Prompt, 
this script allows the agent to 'discover' and 'load' specific skills 
as needed.

Key Architectural Concepts:
    1. Discovery: The agent is given a lightweight index of available skills 
       (Names and 1-line descriptions) in its system prompt.
    2. Lazy Loading: The full documentation for a skill is only injected 
       into the conversation when the agent explicitly calls `load_skill`.
    3. Context Efficiency: This allows the agent to have access to hundreds 
       of specialized skills without exceeding token limits or confusing the 
       model with irrelevant data.

Skill Structure:
    Skills are stored in: skills/<skill_name>/SKILL.md
